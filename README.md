### EAFI-ZON Console Application ðŸŽ“

Welcome to the EAFI-ZON Console Application repository! This project is an academic endeavor to learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and linked lists.

#### About EAFI-ZON ðŸ›’

EAFI-ZON is a platform for purchasing various items, including technology, sports gear, and foreign items.

#### Key Features ðŸŒŸ

- **User-Friendly Menu:** Choose your role as a coordinator or a customer.
- **Coordinator Abilities:** Manage items by adding, modifying, or deleting them using unique IDs.
- **Customer Experience:** Browse items by type, add to your cart, and proceed to checkout or cancel.

#### Special Note ðŸš€

The project prohibited the use of arrays or vectors, opting for linked lists as data collections. Robust validations ensure error-free operation.

#### Detailed Information ðŸ“š

This application allows users to choose between being a coordinator or a customer. Coordinators can add, modify, or delete items by providing the item's ID. Customers can view available items, grouped by type, and add items to their shopping cart. They can also proceed to pay for the items in their cart or cancel the purchase. All functionality was implemented using linked lists, with necessary validations and conditions to handle errors gracefully.
