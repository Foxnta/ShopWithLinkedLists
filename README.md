# EAFI-ZON Console Application
Welcome to the EAFI-ZON Console Application repository! This project showcases a console application for the EAFI-ZON system, built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and linked lists.

About EAFI-ZON
EAFI-ZON is a versatile platform for purchasing various items, including technology, sports gear, and foreign items.

Key Features
User-Friendly Menu: Choose your role as a coordinator or a customer.
Coordinator Abilities: Manage items by adding, modifying, or deleting them using unique IDs.
Customer Experience: Browse items by type, add to your cart, and proceed to checkout or cancel.

Special Note
We've challenged ourselves by not using arrays or vectors, opting for linked lists as data collections. Robust validations ensure error-free operation.
